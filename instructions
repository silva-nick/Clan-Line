Song: while im in away it would be cool if you could to a couple BASIC things
1) talk to some of the interns on wednesday and see what they think of the UI and maybe get them to play
2) get charlie george... to do a bit of play testing and make a list of feature/reworks that they suggest
3) if you could and i know this might be hard for you, but add a new activity for when the game is over, it wont be too hard*
4) if you really want to do some things that would help us win adding sound would be great but you would probably have to follow some
guides online ill link some sound files below**

* (i used a speech to text so it might be a little messy) MAKE A NEW BRANCH FOR THIS
okay song so in order to set the game up so that when it ends we can have the user restart and play game over message the first thing
we're going to want to do set up a while or not a while loop if statement in update method of the game view class that checks if the base's hp i
(the base is the first index in the charArray arraylist so just do charArray.get(0))is equal to or 
less than 0 what you want to do one is I don't I don't know how you're going to do this exactly you might want to change activities or 
just display a message so I could text view at the middle of the screen that says game over then you after that is it you want to go to the
connected thread .write(new byte{4, 0}). Right you going to send it a byte array what I recommend for the byte array you change
the first bite to 4 and then once you're when you're go to the connected thread run method and in the message. Send creative statement 
that basically reads the first bite of the buffer a byte array and if that's equal to 4 then it sends message to Handler. messageSendHandler.
obtainMessager.  and change the what to 1 instead of 0 and then just leave if that's not true if the first 
bite isn't equal to 4 and you want it to set what equals 0 not able to find any wants people to one and then go to the game activity. 
Java and go to the top The Handler inside there's a big switch statement under case one I 
just commented gameover and in that space you want to display a game won screen what basically if everything went right what just happened is that we 
just sent a message from the phone thats base got destroyed to the phone whose base is still alive  now in this 
little section switch statement case 1 what do you want to happen all you basically write a message that says okay or that maybe sets a 
text view or changes the activity so that it displays you win like enemy defeated I don't know whatever you want have a retry button I 
think you should probably just do a new activity but yeah that's pretty much it once in awhile in new active basically it's super easy 
after that then eBay you go to a new activity you just send it back to the old activity but just new reset
