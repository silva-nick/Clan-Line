Song: while im in away it would be cool if you could to a couple BASIC things
1) talk to some of the interns on wednesday and see what they think of the UI and maybe get them to play
2) get charlie george... to do a bit of play testing and make a list of feature/reworks that they suggest
3) if you could and i know this might be hard for you, but add a new activity for when the game is over, it wont be too hard*
4) if you really want to do some things that would help us win adding sound would be great but you would probably have to follow some
guides online ill link some sound files below**

* (i used a speech to text so it might be a little messy)
okay song so in order to set the game up so that when it ends we can have the user restart and play game over message the first thing
we're going to want to do set up a while or not a while loop if statement in update method of the game view class do you want to do there
is basically just a like if Char list of one just the the the index Worthy the base is Carlos of one if that if P of that is equal to or 
less than 0 what you want to do one is I don't I don't know how you're going to do this exactly you might want to change activities or 
just display a message so I could text you at the middle of the screen that says and then you after that is it you want to do connects 
thread connected thread I mean and you want to do. Right you going to send it a byte array what I recommend for the byte array you change
the first bite to 4 and then once you're when you're go to the connected thread run with it and in the message. Send creative statement 
that basically reads the first bite of the buffer a byte array and if that's equal to 5 then it sends message to Handler see it soon. 
Message send message to Handler. Obtain message and change the what to 1 instead of 2 and then just leave if that's not true if the first 
bite isn't equal to 5 and you want it to happen what equals 0 not able to find any wants people to one and then go to the game activity. 
Java and go to the Ferguson right Atop The Handler anaverde kind of have this written in there's a big switch statement undercase one I 
just haven't commented outbreak or haven't commented game and so what basically if everything went right what just happened is that we 
just sent a message from the phone she's a basic Guide to the phone whose base one like still alive destroy the other base now in this 
little section switch statement case 1 what do you want to happen all you basically write a message that says okay or that maybe sets a 
text you or changes the activity so that it displays you win like enemy defeated I don't know whatever you want Hezekiah retry button I 
think you should probably just do a new activity but yeah that's pretty much it once in awhile in new active basically it's super easy 
after that then eBay you go to a new activity you just send it back to the old activity but just new reset
